      UX/UI Design
      
      <p><strong>Role</strong> Senior Designer<br></p>      
        
      <p>As one of the UX/UI designers on a USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) platform for farmers in the United States, I focused on creating a streamlined and intuitive user experience tailored for users navigating complex datasets. This involved developing reusable components and mapping out key user journeys to ensure clarity and consistency throughout the interface.</p>

      <p>To guide the design, we first collaborated with stakeholders during the discovery phase to understand user needs and content structure. From there, I created a journey map that addressed the full flow—from landing on the homepage to filtering and locating specific components. This helped inform the layout hierarchy, making search parameters and results easily accessible.
</p>

      <p>The component cards were designed for scalability and readability. Each card clearly displays the item type, title, description, and update date, using a modular structure that supports rapid scanning and comparison. I applied consistent spacing, visual cues (like labels and dropdowns), and clear call-to-actions to help users find and engage with content efficiently.</p>

      <p>To support usability across devices, I also designed responsive layouts for tablet and mobile views. The UI balances visual simplicity with function, using a modern design system rooted in government accessibility standards.</p>
